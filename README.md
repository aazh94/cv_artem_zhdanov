I am a new immigrant from Russia. In Russia, I worked as a lawyer. I moved to Israel with my family at the end of May 2022. Although I don't have direct experience working as a system administrator, my studies included many practical tasks. Additionally, I have a small personal project: a VPN service based on WireGuard and OpenVPN protocols. The server is hosted on the DigitalOcean platform and is located in Amsterdam. The project was created to help family and friends in Russia access Instagram, YouTube, and Facebook.
